    "# Using the Exploratory Modeling Workbench\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last 7 years, I have been working on the development of an open source toolkit for supporting decision-making under deep uncertainty. This toolkit is known as the exploratory modeling workbench. The motivation for this name is that in my opinion all model-based deep uncertainty approaches are forms of exploratory modeling as first introduced by [Bankes (1993)](http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/opre.41.3.435). The design of the workbench has undergone various changes over time, but it has started to stabilize in the fall of 2016. This summer, I published a paper detailing the workbench [(Kwakkel, 2017)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815217301251). There is an in depth example in the paper, but in a series of blogs I want to showcase the funtionality in some more detail. \n",

    "As a starting point, I will use the Direct Policy Search example that is available for Rhodium [(Quinn et al 2017)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815216302250). I will adapt this code to work with the workbench. In this way, I can explain the workbench, as well as highlight some of the main differences between the workbench and Rhodium.\n",

    "The formulation of the decision rule assumes that `policy` is a dict, which is composed of a set of variables generated either through sampling or through optimization. This is relatively straightforward to do in Rhodium, but not so easy to do in the workbench. In the workbench, a policy is a composition of policy levers, where each policy lever is either a range of real values, a range of integers, or an unordered set of categories. To adapt the DPS version of the lake problem to work with the workbench, we have to first replace the policy dict with the different variables explicitly. \n"

    "This version of the code can be combined with the workbench already. However, we can clean it up a bit more if we want to. Note how there are 2 for loops in the lake model. The outer loop generates stochastic realizations of the natural inflow, while the inner loop calculates the the dynamics of the system given a stochastic realization. The workbench can be made responsible for this outer loop. \n",

    "A quick note on terminology is in order here. I have a background in transport modeling. Here we often use discrete event simulation models. These are intrinsically stochastic models. It is standard practice to run these models several times and take descriptive statistics over the set of runs. In discrete event simulation, and also in the context of agent based modeling, this is known as running replications. The workbench adopts this terminology and draws a sharp distinction between designing experiments over a set of deeply uncertain factors, and performing replications of this experiment to cope with stochastic uncertainty. \n",

If you are trying to run this in parallel using multiprocessing on a windows machine, from within a jupyter notebook, it won't work.

By default, the workbench will use $\\epsilon$-NSGAII. The workbench can be used to search over the levers in order to find a good candidate strategy as is common in Many-Objective Robust Decision Making. The workbench can also be used to search over the uncertainties in order to find for example the worst possible outcomes and the conditions under which they appear. This is a form of worst case discovery. The optimize method takes an optional reference argument. This can be used to set the scenario for which you want to find good policies, or for setting the policy for which you want to find the worst possible outcomes. This makes implementing the approach suggested in [Watson & Kasprzyk (2017)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815216310593) very easy. \n",

    "A third possibility is to perform robust optimization. In this case, the search will take place over the levers, but a given policy is than evaluated for a set of scenarios and the performance is defined over this set. To do this, we need to explicitly define robustness. For this, we can use the outcome object we have used before. In the example below we are defining robustness as the worst 10th percentile over the set of scenarios. We need to pass a `variable_name` argument to explicitly link outcomes of the model to the robustness metrics. \n",
