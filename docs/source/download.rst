The exploratory modeling workbench is currently still under active development. 
The code is thus expected to change rapidly over time, without any
regard for backward compatibility. In addition, the current code base is 
actively being used for research purposes. For these reasons, the current
version is not readily available for download. However, we are willing
to colloborate and perhaps even share the code with anyone expressing a serious
academic interest in our work. Please contanct Jan Kwakkel if you would like to
collaborate or use the EMA workbench.
