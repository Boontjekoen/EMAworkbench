major modifications
===================

 - 	start with optimization, resulted in various modifications to EMAparallel.py
   	and model.py. The pool is now created only once in the lifetime of the 
   	ensemble. 
 - 	SimpleModelEnsemble has been removed and has been replaced with 
   	ModelEnsemble. This new ensemble class contains two new methods for 
   	optimization. The one can be used to optimize on outcomes of interest. 
   	Effectively resulting in a form of Active non-linear testing. The other can 
   	be used for robust optimization. Future extensions will elaborate on this 
   	in order to be able to do maximin and regret type optimization.     

===================
minor modifications
===================

 - parameter uncertainty now raises an error if the values tuple is 
   mis-specified	
 - added a reporting_interval keyword to the 3 methods that result in the 
   running of models. This keyword controls the frequency of info messages 
   about progress.
 - callback now uses the __call__ magic method

=========
Bug fixes
=========
 
 - 	categorical uncertainty created an error if `default` was None. This has 
   	been fixed
 - 	update to modelEnsemble.determine_intersecting_uncertainties. The identity 
   	of an uncertainty is determined by the combination of name and values. Not 
   	just the name. Both modelEnsemble and AbstractUncertainty have been updated
   	to make this work. 
 - 	modification to ModelEnsemble to leave the data types of categorical 
 	uncertainties unchanged. This fixes a problem both in combining Vensim
 	with categorical lookups and a problem in prim.
