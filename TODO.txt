Major changes
-------------
 - Test code coverage
 - prepare for switching to Python 3. Switch to python 3 is conditioned
   on when enthough switches to Python 3. 	
 - Assess benefits of switching to PANDAS as basic data structure
	* pandas looks promising, is a better version of structured array
	* can easily use pytables and hdf5 for storing data on disk. This means
	  that it becomes doable to make a lot more runs and even analyze them 
	  without having to keep all the results in active memory. This also 
	  obviates the need to use a database with the associated issues of mapping
	  the ema data structures to a database. 
	* problem with pandas is that it still requires all the data in memory.
	  It is therefore more sensible to use pytables directly. This can also
	  be used for some of the data provenenace issues via the metadata that
	  one can store in a hdf5 file.  
 - Data provenance questions
 - Optimization
    * only Maximin left
 - Hearn's method
   * a first version, developed by Sibel Eker, is available in sandbox. This is
     more or less finished. All that needs to be done is a final check by Jan 
     Kwakkel, before it can be moved to the normal code.
 - change signature on uncertainties to name, range,
 - check use of tempfile library for multiprocessing instead of the copying
   and deleting of files as done now. It appears that tempfiles are auto 
   deleted when the parent process is killed. This removes the problem of 
   removing directories etc. if the process is killed from within eclipse.
 - reimplement plotting3d to make it consistent with the new plotting 
   implementation. In this reimplementation, we should switch to the 
   matplotlib 3d stuff, which is good enough for what we try to do.

Minor changes
-------------
 - remove dependency on orange and switch to scikits.learn
 - Add connectors for netlogo and repast
   * a basic version for netlogo is now available. This should be finalized
     soon based on the experience with this interface in the work done by
     Ruben. Also, good documentation and several examples are crucial to 
     understand how to use it properly.
 - Have more than one outcome of interest in PRIM
 - Rewrite regret_analysis to work with the new data structure
 - modify lines3d and scatter3d to have a group by option
 - there appear to be various chaco related problems in more recent versions of
   epd... To what extent to we want to maintain the interactive plotting 
   functionality?
   * apparently, Erik, Willem use it frequently...
 - implement some way of specifying files that can be ignored when
   copying working directories under parallel
 - visualizing prim boxes is now based on a sorting on how restricted the 
   dimensions are. To allow cross comparison in case of show_boxes_individually,
   the sorting is based on the first box. We could also modify this so 
   that each box is sorted in its own way. Cross comparing boxes, is however
   then more difficult.  
 - optimization breaks if population is empty, happens only with very small
   population size
 - the lookup of whether a particular experiment has already been run in
   case of the optimization does not scale very well. This should be done
   in a more intelligent way. We should profile the code to figure out where
   the bottleneck is exactly.
