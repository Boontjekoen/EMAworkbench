TODO before stable version
==========================
 - modify lines3d and scatter3d to have a group by option

============================
TODO for next stable version
============================
-------------
Major changes
-------------
 - Test code coverage
 - prepare for switching to Python 3. Switch to python 3 is conditioned
   on when enthough switches to Python 3. 	
 - Assess benefits of switching to PANDAS as basic data structure
	* pandas looks promising, is a better version of structured array
	* can easily use pytables and hdf5 for storing data on disk. This means
	  that it becomes doable to make a lot more runs and even analyze them 
	  without having to keep all the results in active memory. This also 
	  obviates the need to use a database with the associated issues of mapping
	  the ema data structures to a database. 
 - Data provenance questions
 - Optimizaton
 	* it appears pyevolve is the most promising solution for this
 - Hearn’s method
 - investigate an interactive version of PRIM analogous to the one provided
   in the scenario discovery toolkit for R
 
-------------
Minor changes
-------------
 - For clusters, explore potential of using cython for speedups
 - Add more functions that wrap algorithms in orange
 - Add connectors for netlogo and repast
 - Have more than one outcome of interest in PRIM
 - Rewrite regret_analysis to work with the new data structure
 - rename column and categories to groupBy and related pandas terminology 
 - modify all keyword arguments so they do not clash with python internal 
   names (e.g. file)
