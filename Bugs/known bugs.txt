bug/feature in case of using a constant as outcome in vensim
------------------------------------------------------------
If an outcome in the model interface revers to a constant in Vensim, but
time is set to True, a case error is raised suggesting that the run did not 
complete correctly. This is misleading. The real error is that for a constant
time cannot be true. This much more specific error should be raised instead.
The underlying cause is that the .vdf file does not have time serries results
for constants. In turn, the get_value returns an array with shape==1, this is
lower than the expected length of the array, causing the caseError to be 
raised.
