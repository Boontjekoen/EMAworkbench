wish list/ requirements
=======================

 * stop running if it is clear that the remaining data will end up in the 
   dump box anyway
 * interactive mode where the peeling and pasting trajectory for the first
   box is given, user makes a choice, algorithm than redos pasting from there
   before moving to finding a new box. User should also be able to say that 
   the algorithm can stop
 * good visualizations (show boxes, and show peeling trajectory)
 * good tables for peeling trajectory and box limits
 * default only show relevant uncertainties, and sort them based on how 
   restricted they are (after normalizing)
 * box init should be based on uncertainty limits, thus model interface is
   a argument for prim
 * try to use pandas internally, paving the way for moving to pandas in the 
   future
 * use new style obj_function by default and keep using classify
 * investigate multiple classes by using e.g. gini impurity in obj function
 * much clearer error handling in case of no box being found, or, in case of 
   using a classify, the number of cases of interest is either very large 
   or small. 
 * redo the visualize, but then in rotated form and force an aspect ratio on it
